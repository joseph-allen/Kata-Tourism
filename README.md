## Project Brief
Develop a simple web app in React Javascript that shows local tours taking place in Melbourne. The overall design of the web app is for you to determine using the semantic ui found below.

The web app should have the following key pages:
- Home/landing (don’t worry about the text/copy on this page it’s more about the layout of UI components and making it feel like a tourism related website)
- Sign Up (email and password)
- Search results (showing multiple tour search results including featured photo and tour title)
- Detailed tour page (showing the relevant information pulled and displayed from the API)

Core functionality/objectives:
- A user should be able to sign up
- A user to be able to search and for the results to update
- A user to be able to filter on price within search results

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
